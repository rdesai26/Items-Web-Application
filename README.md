- The project I built is to store the ID, name, and price of store items into a database.
- items is the folder for the backend, ui is the folder for the frontend.
- Duplicate ID's cannot be stored into the database.
- A cloud MongoDB database is being used to store data. 
- The login to update,delete, or create items is:
- user: rdesai
- password: password
- The program can be run using npm start while in the items directory.
- The tests can be run using npm test while in the items directory. 
- The live site can be found at https://rdesaiexample.live/
