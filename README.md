# Final project description
- The project I built is to store the ID, name, and price of grocery store items into a database.
- Duplicate ID's cannot be stored into the database.
- A cloud MongoDB database is being used for the inital data set and the login is provided in the connection string. 
- The login to update,delete, or create items is:
- user: rdesai
- password: password
- The program can be run using npm start while in the items directory and npm start while in the users directory.
- The tests can be run using npm test while in the items directory. 
- The live site can be found at http://165.227.177.81/
- http://localhost:3000/api/items or http://165.227.177.81/api/items shows the items as a json.
